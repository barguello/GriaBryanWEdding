<p>Everybody invited to this wedding has been wonderful to us over the years, and we expect nothing from you other than having a good time at our wedding :)  However, we will be gracious and gratefully accept any gift you would like to give us.  We are not signing up at a registry, but we promise not to look at the spreadsheet provided below.  You can enter your gift here if you would like to share with others and see what others have shared.  Alternatively, we are planning a 6-7 month trip around Europe and Asia during the coming year.  Feel free to help us fund our trip in lieu of a materialgift.</p>
