<p> Our reception will be held at the Rainbow nightclub on the north edge of Antonito, CO.  This venue is a rustic nightclub with a cash bar, large dance floor, and cool old-country decor.  The Dutch Mill restaurant of Antonito will be catering a nice Mexican dinner for us starting at 6pm with fun mariachi background music.  Then starting at 7, DJ Pete Gomez will kick off the party with some music and dance.  Below is a map with the Rainbow nightclub at the center</p>
