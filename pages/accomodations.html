<p> In order to save our guests as much money as possible, we are blocking off as few hotels/motels as possible in order to get the best rates.  Please help us with this by telling us your preference through the form below.  We need to know if you prefer a budget motel which will cost $40-$60 per night or a room at the Hilton for $110 per night.  Once we have this information, we may be able to push the prices even lower if we get enough requests for rooms.  Below the map, we have provided information about the places we have in mind.  Also, please send us a message through the comments link to let us know if you really just need a free place to stay while coming to the wedding.  We will work with friends and family to put you up!</p>
